# Sleep-Health-Analysis

1. ## Introduction
This report presents the findings of an analysis conducted on a dataset related to sleep health living. The analysis involved cleaning the data, conducting univariate analysis using Seaborn plots in Python, and utilizing Tableau for visualization. The objective was to gain insights into sleep patterns, identify potential sleep disorders, and understand their correlation with various factors such as age, occupation, stress levels, physical activities, and blood pressure.

2. ## Data Cleaning
To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, data cleaning was performed, addressing missing data, outliers, and invalid entries. This step laid the foundation for a robust and reliable examination of sleep-related variables.

## Univariate Analysis
Univariate analysis was conducted using Seaborn plots in Python. This allowed for a detailed exploration of individual variables, including sleep duration, Blood pressure, Physical activities, Daily steps and sleep quality, providing a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

## Multivariate Analysis
While the initial analysis involved univariate exploration, the multivariate analysis aimed to identify correlations and patterns among multiple variables. However, it is noted that the multivariate analysis did not reveal significant correlations among the variables in this particular dataset.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Additional Field
In the absence of strong correlations from the multivariate analysis, a new field of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) was introduced during the visualization stage in Tableau. This field included Sleep Disorder Rate, Sleep Disorder Count, No Disorder Count, and Age Group, providing a summarized view of key metrics derived from the dataset.

## Observations
## Sleep Disorder by Age
Visualizations revealed a higher prevalence of sleep disorders among females compared to males across different age groups.

## Sleep Disorder by Occupation
Occupations such as Nurses, Teachers, and Salespersons exhibited higher percentages of sleep disorders (41%, 20%, and 19%, respectively), while Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Software Engineers, and Scientists had lower percentages.

## Sleep Disorder by Age Distribution
Participants aged 27 to 59 were observed to have sleep disorders, with peaks at age 44, 43, and 50.

## Stress Level by Occupation
Differences in stress levels were observed across various occupations, with Doctors and Nurses experiencing higher stress levels compared to Salespersons, Lawyers, Teachers, Accountants, Engineers, and other professions. Doctors and nurses exhibit the highest stress levels (8), followed by salespeople (7), lawyers (5), and teachers/accountants (4) with engineers having the lowest stress (3).

## Sleep Disorder by Physical Activities
Individuals with no sleep disorder engage in the highest levels of physical activity, followed by those with sleep apnea, and those with insomnia displaying the lowest activity levels. 

## Sleep Disorder by Age Group
Age groups 20-30 and 31-40 show higher representation of individuals without sleep disorders, while 41-50 leans towards insomnia and 51-60 towards sleep apnea.

## Sleep Disorder by Blood Pressure
Among individuals with normal blood pressure, few have sleep disorders, with sleep apnea being more prevalent than insomnia. Within the prehypertensive range, insomnia is more common than sleep apnea, while the hypertensive group has the highest proportion of sleep apnea cases, followed by insomnia and then individuals without sleep disorders.

## Conclusion
The analysis, combining univariate exploration, multivariate analysis, and Tableau visualizations, provides a comprehensive understanding of sleep health factors. While multivariate analysis did not reveal significant correlations, the visualizations in Tableau allowed for insightful observations and the creation of key performance indicators.

## Recommendations
Continue collecting diverse data to further explore potential correlations.
Utilize Tableau for effective visualization and interpretation of complex datasets.
Consider additional factors or variables that may contribute to sleep health.
